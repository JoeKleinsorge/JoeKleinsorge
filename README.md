### Hi, I'm Joey <a href="https://www.joeykleinsorge.com/"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"></a>

I spend my time designing and developing my company's hybrid cloud self-service automated offerings.

- 🔭 I’m currently building IaC, XaaS, and IaaS automation using VMware's vRealize Suite
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, Terraform, and Python
- 🤖 Have a not-so-secret goal of automating everything. At work or home you can find me trying to make the machines do all the boring stuff
- 💬 Ask me about building reliable automation and mountain biking
